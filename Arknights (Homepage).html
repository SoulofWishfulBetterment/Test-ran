            <h4>Introduction:</h4>

            RPG/tower defense mobile game for IOS and Andriod featuring gacha game mechanics. Arknights (明日方舟) is developed by 
            the Chinese video game development company <abbr title="Hypergryph Network Technology Co. Ltd."><a href="https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Hypergryph#Games:~:text=Hypergryph%20Network%20Technology%20Co.%20Ltd.%20(Chinese%3A%20%E9%B9%B0%E8%A7%92%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C)%2C%20commonly%20known%20as%20Hypergryph%20(HG)%2C%20is%20a%20video%20game%20development%20company%20based%20in%20Shanghai%2C%20China.%20It%20is%20known%20as%20the%20creator%20and%20developer%20of%20Arknights%20and%20the%20publisher%20of%20the%20game%27s%20original%20Chinese%20version.">
            Hypergryph (鹰角网络)</a></abbr> and was released in mainland China on 1 May 2019. Later, the game would be released in 
            Japan, Korea, North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia on the 15th and 16th of Janaury 2020 by Yostar

                </div>
                
            <h4>General Gameplay (Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights#:~:text=The%20core%20gameplay,and%20replicates%20them.">Wikipedia</a>):</h4>            
            <p>The core gameplay is that of a tower defense game, with a number of characters ("operators") as towers. Melee 
            operators can be placed on ground tiles and ranged operators on elevated tiles. Melee operators physically block 
            enemies from advancing, and ranged operators deal ranged damage, heal or otherwise support melee operators. Players 
            must place operators on the correct tiles to prevent the enemy from infiltrating the player's base. Once in place, an 
            operator's skills can be activated after a time for special effects, or they can be withdrawn for redeployment after a 
            delay.
            </p>
            
            <p>Because there is often a limited number of viable solutions, especially at high difficulties, Arknights has also been
            described as a puzzle game. The gameplay does not require quick reaction times (the game is pauseable, and time slows 
            down while commands are issued), but rather on-the-spot tactical analysis and foresight.
            </p>

            <p>As the player progresses through the game, they unlock more stages, operators and resources, and are also introduced 
            to new types of enemies and gameplay mechanics. Levels that have been cleared with a three-star rating can be 
            auto-completed without player input, as the game records the player's actions and replicates them.
            </p>

            <h4>Plot (in-progress):</h4>
            <p>
                Arknights is set in a dystopian world known as Terra whose denizens exhibit kemonomimi features—characteristics of 
                animals or mythological races.
