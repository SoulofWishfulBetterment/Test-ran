                <h4>General Gameplay (Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights#:~:text=The%20core%20gameplay,and%20replicates%20them.">Wikipedia</a>):</h4>            
                <p>The core gameplay is that of a tower defense game, with a number of characters ("operators") as towers. Melee 
                operators can be placed on ground tiles and ranged operators on elevated tiles. Melee operators physically block 
                enemies from advancing, and ranged operators deal ranged damage, heal or otherwise support melee operators. Players 
                must place operators on the correct tiles to prevent the enemy from infiltrating the player's base. Once in place, an 
                operator's skills can be activated after a time for special effects, or they can be withdrawn for redeployment after a 
                delay.
                </p>
                
                <p>Because there is often a limited number of viable solutions, especially at high difficulties, Arknights has also been
                described as a puzzle game. The gameplay does not require quick reaction times (the game is pauseable, and time slows 
                down while commands are issued), but rather on-the-spot tactical analysis and foresight.
                </p>
    
                <p>As the player progresses through the game, they unlock more stages, operators and resources, and are also introduced 
                to new types of enemies and gameplay mechanics. Levels that have been cleared with a three-star rating can be 
                auto-completed without player input, as the game records the player's actions and replicates them.
                </p>
    
                <h4>Plot (in-progress):</h4>
                <p>
                    Arknights is set in a post-apocalyptic world known as Terra where country are formed by a combination of.
